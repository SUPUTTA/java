Collection in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Java collections can achieve all the opertations that you perform on a data such as Searching, Sorting, Insertion, Manipulation and Deletion.
Java collection means a single unit of objects. Java collection framework provides many interfaces(Set, List, Queue and Dequeue) and classes(ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)

Collection Framework: Collection Framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
1. Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
2. Algorithm

collection classes are: ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
Interfaces are Set, List, Queue and DeQueue
Interfaces-
Collection
List- Array List, Vector, LinkedList
Set-Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, Tree Set
Map- Hash Map, Hash Table, TreeMap, Linked Hash Map
Sorted Set
Sorted Map
Queue- Priority Queue

ArrayList: ArrayList class implements the List Interface. It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types.
The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order and is non synchronized. The elements stored in ArrayList can be randomly accessed.

LinkedList: LinkedList implements the collection interface. It uses the doubly linked list to store the elements.
It can store the duplicate elements. It can maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized. In linked list manipulation is fast and no shifting is required.

Vector: Vector uses dynamic array to store the elements. It uses Array List.However it is synchronized and contains many methods,
which are not part of Collection framework.

Stack: Stack is the subclass of vector. It implements the last-in-first-out data structure i.e stack contains all of the methods of vector and also provides its methods like
boolean push(), boolean peak(), boolean push(object o), which defines its properties.

Queue interface: Oueue interface maintains the First-in-First-out order.It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are to be processed.
There are variety of classes like PriorityQueue, Dequeue and ArrayDequeue which implements the queue interface.

Priority Queue: Priority Queue doesnot allow null values to be stored in the queue.Priority Queue implements the Queue interface.
It holds the objects or elements to be processed by their properties.

Set- Set is an interface. Set is used to store the elements in unordered sequence. Doesn't allow to store the duplicate elements.
It can store atmost one null value. It was implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

HastSet(C) - HashSet is used to create a collection that uses hash table for storage. It stores unique elements and allow null values
It is non synchronized. It doesn't maintain insertion order.

LinkedHashSet- It is a class and it stores the unique elements and it allows null values. It is non synchronized.
It maintains insertion order.

HashMap- It is non synchronized and it allows null key and value. The implementation of hashMap is faster.
HashTable- It is synchronized and it doesnot allow values. The implementation is faster.

TreeSet- It uses tree for storage(Ascending order)
