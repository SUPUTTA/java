OOPS:
1.Object
2.Class
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Encapsulation
Object: An entity that has a state and behavior is known as an object.
Ex: chair, pen, table etc.
An object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in the memory
Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's code and data.The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.
Class: Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
Inheritance: When an object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object is known as inheritance. It provides a code reusability.
It is used to achieve the runtime polymorphism
